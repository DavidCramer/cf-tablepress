Caldera Forms - TablePress
=============

Auto-populate a table from TablePress


**Setup**
Create a table as usual.
For the first row, use the field slug you want that colum to be for.
Leave a second row blank

![example setup](http://cl.ly/image/2g3Z1n2o2c0p/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-23%20at%203.03.46%20PM.png)

in the shortcode, add form="form name to use" attribute like `[table id=5 form="contact form"]`
You can also use the form ID like `[table id=5 form="CF53dde9b631713"]`

Thats it.
